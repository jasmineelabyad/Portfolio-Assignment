# Professional GitHub Portfolio Setup

## Executive Summary
This repository serves as an evidence locker for my GitHub Portfolio assignment. It demonstrates professional repository structure, documentation standards, and adherence to security-oriented best practices for organizing technical work.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to show that I understand how to:
- Structure projects using professional conventions
- Separate scripts, proof, and diagnostics into clear locations
- Prepare technical work for auditing and review

## Repository Structure
- `/scripts` — Location for automation scripts, commands, or configuration artifacts  
- `/proof` — Location for screenshots/logs that verify success states  
- `/diagnostics` — Location for troubleshooting notes documenting errors and resolutions  

## Verification Plan
Evidence stored in `/proof` will include:
- Screenshot of my GitHub profile (mission, toolkit, pinned repo)
- Screenshot of this repository showing required structure

## Diagnostics Plan
Any issues encountered during setup will be recorded in `/diagnostics` using the format:
- Issue encountered  
- Root cause  
- Resolution  
- Verification of fix
